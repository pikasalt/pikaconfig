This is my personal config, it is not intended to be used by everyone, but I have made it publicly available.

The config is intended to be used alongside mastercomfig, as it is structured to use it's addon system.
To use it without mastercomfig, simply move everything in the overrides folder to the config's base folder.

This config includes:
- Binds file to manage all binds used and created by the config
- Settings file to manage all settings added by the config.
- Simple yet highly customizable Crosshair/Viewmodel Switcher, with optional viewmodel-only mode. (uses Arrow keys)
	My crosshair switcher is a modified/combined version of cfg.tf`s and Ghost1294551`s scripts. They are
	simplified to cause as little headaches as possible when editing the script. Anyone is free to publish a standalone
	version of this script, just be sure to credit me as well as the other authors.
- Simple loadout switcher, hold Right ALT and use 1-4 to select a loadout.
- Pyro detonator jump bind (Mouse Wheel Button), great for getting max height. (remeber to re-crouch after using the bind)
- Soldier rocket jump bind (Right Click), I don't use it but included it for those who might want it. (remeber to re-crouch after using the bind)
- Graphical edits. These are only for preference and do not provide vast optimizations like mastercomfig.
- Tabgraph enabled by default, can be disabled in settings.

Most notable game settings changed:
- Fov and viewmodels are set to 90
- Quickswitch and autoreload are enabled
- Medic radar is enabled and set to 59% of patient health
- Medic autoheal (healing without holding the button) is enabled
- Hitsounds enabled, have different pitches for high and low damage
- Killsounds enabled, pitches are the same by default
- All tutorial prompts disabled.
